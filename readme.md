# Something New, Every Day

## What is SNED?

The web is a large and curious place. Some websites are incredibly informative, some are entertaining, and some provide little moments of relief. The only places that come close to providing all of these are social media platforms, which begs the question: <em>what if it wasn't?</em>

And with that, the idea for <strong>SNED</strong> was born!

## Status

At the time of writing (9/23/22), the project is very much in its infancy and needs substantial development to achieve the end goal. There will be days where nothing will make sense, and it seems pointless, but that should be overshadowed by the experience to be had in developing a site like this, as well as genuine belief that the success of the site will be deserving of the effort put into it.

## Current Development Roadmap
<ol>
<strong><em><li>Establish base framework</li></em></strong>
<li>Determine means of 'resetting' the site daily</li>
<li>Develop and deliver multiple pages for release</li>
<li>Promote, promote, promote</li>
</ol>

### Developing on this repo

The application is running Typescript React through Vite.js. Yarn is the package manager of choice, as it doesn't take nine years to build the application. To begin development, clone the branch of your choosing, create a new branch, and commit regularly (that's a local operation, don't be scared of it if you aren't familiar with the process!). When you feel that you have made substantial progress on a section of the site (or simply the site's functionality), push your branch to the repo and submit a pull request.

Now, to <em>actually develop</em>, you should make sure yarn is set up and run this from the parent folder:  
`yarn && yarn dev`  
  
If that doesn't work, I can assure you it's on your end üòÅ
